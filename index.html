Knot Concordance Calculator</font></a> This calculator expresses any linear combination of low crossing number knots in terms of a indpendent set of knots, and compute the algebraic and geometric order of the knot in the concordance group.  The calculator was built by Julia Collins.

TO: The Members of the Board of Trustees of Indiana University <br>
Sirs:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Your Committee, appointed by President Wells for the purpose of conducting a survey of the University, begs leave to submit herewith the first two parts of its final report. Yet to follow, is a brief report on the
Indianapolis units.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp Your Committee has taken pains to insure the accuracy of the factual matter presented and it has made every effort to formulate its judgments moderately and fairly. It has sought and obtained the friendly cooperation of the faculty and administrative officers of the University and it wishes to acknowledge its very great obligations to them. 

<br>&nbsp One cannot be dogmatic about education or educational processes, and the Committee submits its recommendations fully conscious of the fact that they involve
many matters on which the judgments of reasonable men
are at variance. Nevertheless, and without apology,
the Committee puts forward its work as a sincere effort on the part of the University community to solve its
more pressing problems.<br>

&nbsp Respectfully submitted,<br>
&nbsp March 21, 1939. <br>&nbsp Wendell W.  Wright <br> &nbsp Herman T. Briscoe<br>
&nbsp Fowler V. Harper
