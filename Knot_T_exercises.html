The following is a list of comments concerning exercises.  For comments and errata concerning <A HREF = "Knot_T_refs.html">references</A>, <A HREF = "Knot_T_math.html">mathematics</A>, or a <A HREF = "Knot_T_page.html">page by page</A> listing, select the desired option.    <BR>

(p. = Page, e. = Exercise, l. = Line, t. = Theorem, c. = Corollary, f. = Figure, d. = Definition.)

<UL><LI> p.10, e.7:  The deformation is quite difficult to find;  Perko's paper, listed in the reference has a series of figures illustrating it.
 
<LI> p.26, e.5.5:  Here "inversion" means a deformation of the knot to its reverse.
 
<LI> p.32, e.1.2:  Deform the illustrated knot into a standard picture of the unknot, using only Reidemeister moves.
 
<LI> p.35, e.2.2:  n  is the number of half twists; for example, in Figure 3.6a, n is the number of crossings.
 
<LI> p.36, e.2.4b:  Theorem 2, not 1.  e.2.4d: Theorem 2, not 1.  Also, in Figure 3.7 the diagram on the left illustrates a right-handed crossing.
 
 
<LI> p.88, e.1.7b:  (1,5,3,4) is the product of three transpositions, not four.
  
<LI> p.94, e.2.2:  Only one of the labelings is correct, not two.
 
  
<LI> p.99, e.3.4:  Knot 6_1 cannot be labeled with transposition, but can be labeled with 4-cycles.  Knot 9_46 can be labeled in both ways, not just with transpositions.  (The point remains the same; these knots are distinguished using S_4 labelings only if the conjugacy classes of labels are considered.)
 
<LI> p.104, e.4.1:  The second relation is clearly wrong.  Check the relations on p.101.
 
<LI> p.123, e.3.9:  Reference should be Exercise 1.5, not 2.5.

<LI> p.140, e.3.4:  One can assume  p  is always positive.  In this case, the knots are equivalent if and only if q - q' = 0 mod p, or qq' = 1 mod p.
