Most of the errors listed here were corrected in the second printing, which was published in 1995.  Unfortunatly, the printing number is not listed in the front material.  To tell which you version you have, look up "Whitehead link" in the index.  If it is listed as appearing on page 39 you have the old edition; if not you have the corrected edition<A HREF = "http://iu-math-86.math.indiana.edu/~jihokim/bb10/">.</A>   

<P>
I have divided the list of errata for the first printing into several overlapping categories.  Spelling and punctutation errors are not included.<BR>


<UL>
<LI> <A HREF = "Knot_T_page.html">Page by page</A>: a complete list, ordered by page number.<P>


<LI> <A HREF = "Knot_T_exercises.html">Exercises</A>: this section now focuses mostly on errata; hints and further comments will be added later.<P>

<LI> <A HREF = "Knot_T_math.html">Mathematics</A>:  a theorem is slightly misstated, a definition or example is not quite right, etc.<P>

<LI> <A HREF = "Knot_T_refs.html">References</A>:  at a number of places a reference of the type "see Theorem 2" needs to be changed to something like "see Theorem 3."<P>
